# analogatique Â· web gallery for you photos

A beautiful static gallery generator (written in Rust ðŸ¦€) for anyone who wants to showcase their photos, whether film scans or digital images. It keeps the analog spirit with vintage aesthetics and Atkinson dithering while making it easy to create stunning web galleries.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently under development and may introduce breaking changes.

## Quick Start

1. Create a new directory for your gallery.

```zsh
mkdir films && cd films
```

2. Set up the required structure.

```zsh
mkdir photos templates
```

3. Create `config.toml`.

```toml
[site]
title = "Films"
subtitle = "Took on 35mm."
description = "A collection of analog moments."
author = "NicÃ©phore NiÃ©pce"

[dithering]
enabled = true

[display]
hide_filenames = true

[footer]
links = [
    { url = "", name = "" },
    { url = "", name = "" },
]
```

4. Create `metadata.txt` by writing one JSON line for each photo.

```json
{"filename": "photo1.jpeg", "date": "15-06-2023", "name": "Sunset at the Beach", "camera": "Canon AE-1", "film": "FUJICOLOR C200"}
{"filename": "photo2.jpeg", "date": "20-06-2023", "camera": "Polaroid SX-70", "film": "B&W SX-70"}
```

5. Copy the default templates.

```zsh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/un1970ix/analogatique/master/templates/index.html > templates/index.html
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/un1970ix/analogatique/master/templates/styles.css > templates/styles.css
```

6. Add your photos to the `photos/` directory.

7. Generate your gallery:

```zsh
analogatique
```

Your gallery will be created in the `public/` directory!

## Metadata Format

Each line in `metadata.txt` should be a JSON object with these fields:
